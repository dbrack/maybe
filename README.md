# TypeScript Maybe Monad implementation
Haskell inspired [Maybe Monad](https://wiki.haskell.org/Maybe)/[Data Type](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.10.1.0/docs/Data-Maybe.html) implementation in TypeScript.
The base monad implementation obeys the [Monad laws](https://wiki.haskell.org/Monad_laws).

Run `npm install` to get started.

Run `npm test --watch` if you want to tinker with the code and re-run the tests automatically.

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains some usage examples. However, most useful is to take a look at the [tests](src/Maybe.test.ts).
